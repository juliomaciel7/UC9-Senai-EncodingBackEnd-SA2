:rocket: *Description:*

Repository created with the objective of developing and sharing content on "Programming Logic", "Object-Oriented Programming" and "Coding with Native .NET Classes, such as StreamWrite and StremReader", to store data
in files.

The project consists of an Individual and Legal Person register, in the Console, which contains Abstract Class, Inheritance, Abrasration, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and methods with validations of CPF, CNPJ, Date of birth and Type of address.

C# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are:

+ *Abstraction:* In this principle, we model the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes, to define an abstract representation of a system
+ *Encapsulation:* This principle consists of hiding the internal state and functionality of an object, and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
+ *Inheritance*: Consists of the ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.
+ *Polymorphism:* Consists of the ability to implement inherited properties and/or methods in different ways in various abstractions.

Also, as Interfaces were used in the project, here is a description of them:

+ *Interfaces - defined behavior for various types:* Contains definitions for a group of related functionality that a concrete, ie non-abstract, class and/or a struc must implement.
As of C#8.0, an interface can define a default implementation for members, but it cannot be instantiated.

StreamWriter and StreamReader Classes

+ StreamWriter object to write a file.
+ StreamReader object to read and display a file.

## :keyboard: Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

### Back End

+ [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/csharp/)
C# is a mature, simple, and modern programming language, and provides a scalable and secure programming experience that runs on .NET.

+ [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/dotnet/)
.NET is a free open source development platform for building various types of applications, such as:
>+ Web Apps, Web APIs, and Microservices
>> Serverless functions in the cloud
>+ Cloud-native apps
>+ Mobile apps
+ Desktop apps such as:
>+ Windows WPF
>+ Windows Forms
>> UWP (Universal Windows Platform)


Besides
>+ Games
>> Internet of Things (IoT)
>+ Machine learning
>+ Console apps
>+ Windows services

### IDE (Integrate Development Environment)
+ [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en-us/vs/community/)
90% of the coding was done with Visual Studio because it has numerous features that contribute to development agility.

### Code Editor
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
10% of the coding was done with Visual Studio Code, for quick testing purposes.
